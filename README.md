The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

The first two numbers of the fibonacci sequence are 0, 1.

For example, the first 8 numbers of the fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13

Create a method that prints out the first x numbers of the fibonacci sequence.

Your output should be in one line, with each number separated by a space. You may assume that x is at least 2.

Use a for loop to implement the method.

Examples:
  printFibonacci(2) -> 0 1
  printFibonacci(8) -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13
  printFibonacci(5) -> 0 1 1 2 3
  printFibonacci(14) -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233
  printFibonacci(25) -> 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765 10946 17711 28657 46368
